.SYNOPSIS
	This script performs the installation or uninstallation of an application(s).
.DESCRIPTION
	The script is provided as a template to perform an install or uninstall of an application(s).
	The script either performs an "Install" deployment type or an "Uninstall" deployment type.
	The install deployment type is broken down into 3 main sections/phases: Pre-Install, Install, and Post-Install.
	The script dot-sources the AppDeployToolkitMain.ps1 script which contains the logic and functions required to install or uninstall an application.
.PARAMETER DeploymentType
	The type of deployment to perform. Default is: Install.
.PARAMETER DeployMode
	Specifies whether the installation should be run in Interactive, Silent, or NonInteractive mode. Default is: Interactive. Options: Interactive = Shows dialogs, Silent = No dialogs, NonInteractive = Very silent, i.e. no blocking apps. NonInteractive mode is automatically set if it is detected that the process is not user interactive.
.PARAMETER AllowRebootPassThru
	Allows the 3010 return code (requires restart) to be passed back to the parent process (e.g. SCCM) if detected from an installation. If 3010 is passed back to SCCM, a reboot prompt will be triggered.
.PARAMETER TerminalServerMode
	Changes to "user install mode" and back to "user execute mode" for installing/uninstalling applications for Remote Destkop Session Hosts/Citrix servers.
.PARAMETER DisableLogging
	Disables logging to file for the script. Default is: $false.
